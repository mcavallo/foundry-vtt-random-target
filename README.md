# Random Target

**Random Target** is a Foundry VTT module that lets you quickly select a random target from the tokens in your current scene.

When activated, the module opens a window displaying the tokens in your current scene, organized into categories such as disposition or actor type. This allows you to easily browse and pre-select eligible candidates. Once you're satisfied with your selection, simply roll to determine which one is randomly targeted.

# Settings

The module features a settings page that lets you customize the experience to your liking, such as choosing which 
categories are displayed, whether a notification should appear in the chat, and whether the selection window should remain open after use. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/mcavallo/foundry-vtt-random-target/wiki/Settings).
